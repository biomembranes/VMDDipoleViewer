What the code does
------------------

Often in simulations we want to understand the orientation and magnitudes of dipoles. This code groups up
atoms (user definable) into clusters and then performs basic statistical analysis on the computed dipole to
give values for the magnitude and direction of these dipoles. This may be useful in understanding countless
interactions and physical behaviour.

The code was designed for lipid systems but that does not mean it will not work with other systems - you 
simply have specific the atomic groups that you are interested in. We have used as your base system the
ceramide lipid which is composed into groups - the head groups having dipoles which we loosely name: amide
and glycerol for housekeeping.


Running the code
----------------

1. You must put in details of the atoms you want to examine in the code. These are currently named: amide and
glycerol. You can rename these or pick up the atoms of interest and put these back in the code.

	set amide [atomselect top "name C25 N23 H24 O26 and (resid $i)" frame $frame]
	set glycerol [atomselect top "name C19 C16 C15 C14 C20 O21 H22 and (resid $i)" frame $frame]

2. You must specify which grouping to look at in the following lines:

	set dipa [measure dipole $amide -debye]

This means you will only compute one dipole at a time over a number of frames but you can easily change this
if you so desire to incorporate more than one measurement simultaneously.

3. Open VMD with your files. For example:

	vmd md.xtc md.gro md.psf

4. Copy and paste the code into the VMD TCL window or run in the usual way.
